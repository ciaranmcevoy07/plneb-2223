      <title>Please Note: This glossary is a work in progress. We revise
      it periodically to include more terms. Therefore, it may not
      contain all the words you will need. If you cannot find a term in
      this list, please check the resources referenced in the Virtual
      Library. In addition, if you do not understand a medical term
      while interpreting, please ask the doctor or patient to explain it
      further and then use his or her explanation in your
      interpretation.</title>

        Furthermore, there may be additional regional ways, colloquial
        or formal, to express in Spanish some of the medical terms
        listed here. We have added a third column so you can record
        these terms as you encounter them. Bring these terms to the
        attention of your instructor and fellow students. Your
        suggestions may help to enrich the linguistic diversity of our
        glossary.
